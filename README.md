# Social Network API # 

## Description ##

This repository contains a MongoDB backend social network API. Users can share thoughts, react to thoughts and add and delete friends. I really enjoyed creating this API as I 
found Mongo really enjoyable to work with and I discovered so much about using MongoDB.
